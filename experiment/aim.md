**Introduction**

Structural elements and machine components made of a ductile material are usually designed so that the material will not yield under the expected loading conditions. When the element or component is under uniaxial stress , the value of the normal stress σ<sub>x</sub>, which will cause the material to yield, may be obtained readily from a tensile test conducted on a specimen of the same material, since the test specimen and the structural element or machine component are in the same state of stress. Thus, regardless of the actual mechanism which causes the material to yield, we may state that the element or component will be safe as long as σ<sub>x</sub><σ<sub>y</sub>, where σ<sub>y</sub> is the yield strength of the test specimen. 

 
**Objective**

- To investigate the principal stresses σ<sub>a</sub> and σ<sub>b</sub> at any given point of a structural element or machine component when it is in a state of plane stress.

- To evaluate the two different yield criteria ( Tresca and Von Mises ) for ductile materials under plane stresses.
