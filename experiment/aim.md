The experiment is designed to provide measured values of strains in the thin cylinder when subjected to internal pressure and torsional loading. The stresses derived from these strains may then be compared with calculated values. 

To study the stress and strain developed in a thin wall cylinder internal pressure. To determine the Poissonâs ratio and youngâs modulus of the cylinder material.
