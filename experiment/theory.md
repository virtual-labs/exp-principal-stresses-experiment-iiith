## Maximum-Shearing-Stress Criterion

According to this criterion, a given structural component is safe as long as the
maximum value τ<sub>max</sub> of the shearing stress in that component remains smaller than the
corresponding value of the shearing stress in a tensile-test specimen of the same
material as the specimen starts to yield.

The maximum value of the shearing stress under a centric axial load is equal to half
the value of the corresponding normal axial stress, hence the maximum shearing stress
in a tensile-test specimen is ½σ<sub>Y</sub> as the specimen starts to yield. On the other hand, for
plane stress, the maximum value τ<sub>max</sub>> of the shearing stress is equal to ½|σ<sub>max</sub>| if the
principal stresses are either both positive or both negative, and to ½|σ<sub>max</sub> – σ<sub>min</sub>| if the maximum stress is positive and the minimum stress negative. Thus, if the principal
stresses σ<sub>a</sub> and σ<sub>b</sub> have the same sign, the maximum-shearing-stress criterion gives

## Maximum-Distortion-Energy Criterion

According to this criterion, known as the von Mises criterion, a given structural component is safe as long as the maximum value of the distortion energy per unit volume in that material remains smaller than (u<sub>d</sub>)<sub>Y</sub>, the distortion energy per unit volume required to cause yield in a tensile-test specimen of the same material. If the distortion energy per unit volume in an isotropic material under plane stress is u<sub>d</sub>, the maximum- distortion-energy criterion indicates that the structural component is safe as long as u<sub>d</sub> < (u<sub>d</sub>)<sub>Y</sub>, i.e., as long as the point of coordinates σ<sub>a</sub> and σ<sub>b</sub> falls within the area. This area is bounded by the ellipse of equation :
